가천대학교 졸업작품 2분반<br/>
양한진, 이준수, 황병훈

### Motivation
1. Most of us do not tend to pay attention to the care symbols on the label of clothes.
2. Also, the laundry method varies according to type of clothes.
3. So we have experienced unwanted results such as pulling out favorite clothing from washing machine shrunken, being discolored or being damaged.

### Description
Our program detect picture of care tag which user take.<br/>
And do image processing to detect symbols in care tag easily.<br/>
Then, recognize symbols using YOLO v2 and show how to wash clothes in text.<br/>
