### Motivation
1. Most of us do not tend to pay attention to the care symbols on the label of clothes.
2. Also, the laundry method varies according to type of clothes.
3. So we have experienced unwanted results like shrunken, being discolored or being damaged clothes by wrong laundry method.
4. This unwanted result can not be compensation by company

### Description

  And do image processing to detect symbols in care tag easily.<br/>
